//        In this class, define a menu in the following way: we have a while loop with a true condition.
//        Inside this loop, first we ask the user who they are.
//        If they are the owner of the hospital, we first ask for their password.
//        He can change his password.
//        If the password matches the password value in the information class, they enter the owner's menu,
//        otherwise it gives a warning and returns to the previous menu. In the owner menu, we have options
//        to delete a doctor, add a doctor, delete a nurse, add a nurse, delete an employee, and add an employee.
//        If they are a doctor, we ask for their password, and if their password is among the passwords of
//        the doctor array in the information class, we enter the doctor's menu. In this menu, we have the
//        option to visit a patient, He can change his password or choose to re-enter all his information
//        (except ID), and he can also delete a desired visit. If they are a nurse, we ask for their password,
//        and if their password is among the passwords of the nurse array in the information class,
//        we enter the nurse's menu. In this menu, we have options to visit a patient and register a patient,
//        He can change his password or choose to re-enter all his information (except ID),
//        and he can also delete a desired visit.
//        Note: If an employee wants to change their information or password, a new object should not be created.
//        Rather, new information should be obtained and this new information updated for the same object.
